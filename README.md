## Project Overview

A slow paced block matching game that would serve as a resource system for a 2D space game. Matching different blocks in different orders would create different parts. This was the second major prototype I worked on, is was my first time creating a robust grid system and using Unity’s animation systems. Overall it was a good learning experience but was again too ambitious.  

## Installation

The project is updated to Unity 5.5.1f1 and can be run from that version. 

## Implementation

The grid is a simple 2 dimensional array that contains many instantiated block objects. The claw object moves the first block selected to the last location selected. 

## Project Problems

There was no system implemented to move parts once created, I couldn’t find a fun way to restrict the types of parts that could be created through the grid.
